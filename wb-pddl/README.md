# Description

Assume that you have a puzzle consisting of four cells. The first cell contains a black tile, the next two are white ones, and the last cell is empty.
A tile can be moved into a neighbored empty cell (costing one unit) or a tile can “jump” over at most one cells into an adjacent empty cell (costing two units). The goal of the game is to have the black tile to the right of the white tiles, while the empty cell may have any arbitrary position.
